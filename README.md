# Rule-Based-Systems
This project builds a rule-based system in CLIPS to generate event menus. We analyse the problem, gather culinary knowledge, design and document an ontology in Protégé, decompose the task into subproblems, and implement incremental rule modules that propose three valid menus matching user constraints.
